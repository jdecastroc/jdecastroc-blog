title: About
---

I come from a [little town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colmenar_Viejo) near Madrid (Spain). Computer Engineer who since childhood has had an interest in the world of development.

With 18 years I moved to Barcelona to study the higher technician in systems administration course and after finishing it I decided to continue with the computer engineering at [Universidad Europea](http://universidadeuropea.es/en/) while working as a sysadmin in order to grow professionally and personally.

After finishing the university I decided to come to [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) (Japan) as a vital challenge with the purpose of learning a new language, culture and customs. Every day I continue enjoining learning about the environment which surrounds me.

I like the back-end development, the logic behind the projects as well as try and learn new technologies that are emerging day by day. I like working with enthusiastic people who put all their effort into advancing together and those who believe in the team. I like good practices and learn from my environment while teaching or while being taught.
