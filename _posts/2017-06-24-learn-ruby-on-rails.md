# Learning Ruby on Rails (RoR)

## Reasons to learn a new programming language and motivation
When studying at the university I needed to choose whether to develop my graduation project with Java or with Ruby. At that time, I was more confident that developing it with Java would be better to set the skills I was had been learning through the university subjects (mostly java and C++). That made me kind of abandon the idea of learning ruby and ruby on rails until I got japan. 

When I came to Japan I realize that the local Ruby community in Japan is pretty big so I felt that it was the moment to start learning what I didn't have time the last year. In order to accomplish that I joined an udemy course called [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course) which I really recommend as the teachers are pretty good and teach by making you actually program some projects with ruby and RoR.

I really like how java works but talking about Ruby... I really fell in love with it. It is simple, productive, easy to read and understand and the fact that EVERYTHING is an object make programming with it so much fun. I have been developing my own projects to understand better the concepts I was studying in the course and also go a bit further and being honest I really recommend to any web developer to have a shoot to ruby as I'm sure is not going to disappoint!

Talking about RoR I would say that it was kind of my first approach to such a complete framework after Spring for Java and I was so surprise how fast is to develop an deploy projects. I still learning the basics but even the new version RoR 5 implements a way to generate a project for an API which I use to develop my own crawler API in a few hours.
## What did I learn until now
 - How Ruby works. Main operations, syntax, data structures, modules instead of abstract classes and interfaces...
 - The basics of Ruby on Rails. MVC structure, Route, CRUD operations, Styling Rails Applications, Associations and Authentication Systems, Testing with RSpec...
 - Use libraries like nokogiri and RSpec for crawling and test development
 - The differences between the creation of a normal Rails application and a [API-only Rails application](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html) available with the new version of Rails 5
 - Good practices oriented to the creation of APIs within Rails like separating the functions/tests depending of the version of the API and how to respect the framework folder structure

## Developed projects for learning
- [Alpha blog](https://github.com/jdecastroc/alpha-blog) is the first out of 4 projects which belongs to [The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course) 
- [Music discoverer](https://github.com/jdecastroc/music-discoverer) is a project which idea I developed last year with PHP and Java. I wanted to re-do the project with RoR so I just made a class diagram and apply the new knowledge to deploy fast a webpage which allow the user to select some music reddits and create a playlist by mixing them. The challenge point of this project was how to use nokogiri to accomplish the web crawling objective.
- [Reddit music API](https://github.com/jdecastroc/reddit-music-api) is a project which follows the objective of the previous one but with the difference that is an API REST. Reddit Music API is a project done to learn deeply about Rails framework focusing on how to create a simple API and how to develop test for RoR with RSpec.

## Conclusion
Even if I could not dedicate all the time that I wanted to my learning is going step by step without stop. I realize that on the internet lot of professionals are afraid about the future of Ruby or RoR and most of them are lost about how to continue their professional paths. I don't think that we, as software engineers, should stuck into one technology but have the benefit to learn lot of new technologies and frameworks which fits better or not depending of the project. Nowadays the market is full of new growing technologies and thatâ€™s even positive as we can choose where to specialize. I really like all what is related with backend development and RoR has been like a breath of fresh air.

Being honest is the first time that after finishing the university I learn something by myself alone just for fun and I really think that's the point, the motivation. I cannot stop and this following weeks I have my head full of projects to develop with my new skills and really, cannot wait for it.

Did you enjoy learning Ruby and RoR as much as me? Have any question about it? Just let me know!
